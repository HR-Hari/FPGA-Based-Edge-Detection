# FPGA-Based-Edge-Detection
This project implements a synthesizable Sobel Filter for edge detection on the Basys3 FPGA (Artix-7). It features a custom Verilog core utilizing a 3x3 sliding window architecture and hardware-optimized arithmetic to minimize resource usage. The design is validated via behavioral simulation in Vivado against a bit-accurate Python reference.
